            <h2>What do I do after job?</h2>
            <p>Like greatest minds in "IT" industry suggest - I am improving all the time my languages set, soft skills
                and ability to create architectural solutions.</p>
            <p>I also found the way of great entertainment and hobby in creating games. I have no big success on my
                account but you can find one title online.

            <h2>What is my other hobby and interests?</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I am big enthusiast of music from 70,80,90's. I can place here long list of bands but it is so long that
                I will stay with a few most liked by me for which I come back very soon.</p>
            <p>New Wave, Synth Pop and Rock are the most loved music types by me and because of that I usually come back
                to bands like: <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8&list=PLSZhbpKoqTC64fmHcdFSEZuP3ceRKtgiV&ab_channel=DavidByrne">Talk
                    Talk, New Order, OMD, Bronski Beat.</a> And because I am geek
                it is obvious that second track on my list is "Revenge of the Nerds OST"</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Movies</h3>
            <p>As you probably saw in my short bio. I do love gangster movies. Scarface (1983) I love most. But besides
                of that general rule which is going through my mind when I choose any movie is the fact
                that movie is "about something" - just INTJ things. Dramas, comedies, thrillers or based on real life
                stories let me feel entertainment.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Books</h3>
            <p>This paragraph because of me being nerd and geek should be long. But need of being strict and fully
                pragmatic will let me mention only types of books I like.
                More about titles I hope you will find in my blog. So, most beloved genres of books are also stronger
                like economy, political and obviously programming books same as a little lighter like fantasy books.</p>
