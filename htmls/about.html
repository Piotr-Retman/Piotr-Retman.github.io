            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Piotr Retma≈Ñczyk and I am programmer for a few years. In everyday work I am Senior Java Engineer in AUTO1 Group</p>
            <p>Doing this business is my choice, my passion and this is what I want in everyday life. I caught the bug when I was studying during my first degree.
                This is what I love to do and improving skills which are strictly connected with my passion is the
                one of the most important thing in my life. My journey started in 2011 with Python scripts and after this moment during the years I had opportunity to work with plenty of technologies and languages.</p>

            <h2>Day by day</h2>
            <p>In everyday coding I use languages like Java or JS which are strictly connected with backend in my case. Mostly, my career is based on being typical backend
                developer. But I am not telling "no" to any technologies which let me create mobile, desktop and web applications.</p>
